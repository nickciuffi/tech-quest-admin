# tech-quest admin

This is a project to practice my **Next.js**, **Typescript** and **Node.js** abilities. <br>
This project has three parts: <br>
1. The front-end: https://github.com/nickciuffi/tech-quest;
2. the back-end: https://github.com/nickciuffi/tech-quest-api;
3. The admin: Which you can see in this repository; 


# Tech stack:

For the admin part, I used React.js with typescript.
Considering that the data is very complex in this project, I had to create many edit, delete and create pages.

# Conclusion

This was a very laborious part of the project, where I cound learn many things and improve a lot of aspects in my developing skills.
